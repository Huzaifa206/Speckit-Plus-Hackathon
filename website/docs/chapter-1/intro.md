# Chapter 1: Foundations of Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence

Welcome to the foundational chapter of Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This chapter introduces you to the core concepts that bridge digital artificial intelligence with embodied machines operating in the physical world.

## What You'll Learn

In this chapter, you will explore:

- The fundamental differences between digital AI and embodied intelligence
- How artificial intelligence becomes physically manifest in robotic systems
- The architecture of robotic nervous systems using ROS 2
- Simulation environments that enable safe development of physical AI systems

## Learning Path

This chapter is structured in three progressive lessons:

1. **From Digital AI to Physical Intelligence** - Understanding the transition from abstract AI models to embodied agents
2. **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Mastering the communication framework for humanoid robots
3. **Digital Twins: Simulating Reality** - Creating virtual environments for testing and development

Each lesson builds upon the previous one, following our principle of **Progressive Complexity**. You'll start with conceptual foundations and gradually work toward practical implementation.

## Hands-On Approach

Following our **"Learn by Building"** principle, each lesson includes:

- Practical exercises you can run on your system
- Simulation environments to test your understanding
- Code examples that demonstrate real-world applications
- Mini challenges to reinforce key concepts

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have:

- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with fundamental AI concepts (neural networks, machine learning)
- Access to a system capable of running simulation environments (Docker recommended)
