# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: From Digital Intelligence to Embodied Machines

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This book bridges the gap between digital artificial intelligence and embodied machines that operate in the real world.

## About This Book

This educational resource is designed for:
- Beginners to intermediate learners
- CS/AI students transitioning into robotics
- Developers familiar with Python and basic AI concepts

The content follows a simulation-first approach, emphasizing safe and efficient development of robotic systems before real-world deployment.

## Learning Philosophy

Our approach follows the **"Learn by Building"** principle:
- Every concept leads to a simulation
- Every lesson includes a ROS node
- Every module produces a visual or physical behavior

## Course Structure

The book is organized into progressive chapters that build upon each other:

- **Chapter 1**: Foundations of Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence
  - Lesson 1: From Digital AI to Physical Intelligence
  - Lesson 2: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
  - Lesson 3: Digital Twins: Simulating Reality

## Getting Started

Begin with [Chapter 1: Foundations of Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence](./chapter-1/intro.md) to understand the fundamental concepts that distinguish Physical AI from traditional digital AI systems.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental AI concepts
- Access to a system capable of running simulation environments
