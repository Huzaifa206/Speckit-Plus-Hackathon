> **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: From Digital Intelligence to Embodied Machines**
>
> An educational platform for understanding how artificial intelligence becomes embodied in physical robotic systems

## 📚 Overview

The Speckit-Plus-Hackathon project is an educational platform focused on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. It serves as a comprehensive learning resource that bridges the gap between abstract AI models and their embodiment in physical robotic systems. The platform uses a simulation-first approach to safely and efficiently develop robotic systems before real-world deployment.

This project was created as part of a hackathon submission, demonstrating the capabilities of the Spec-Driven Development (SDD) framework and the "Speckit-Plus" tooling for creating structured, well-documented educational content about Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

## 🎯 Core Principles

The project is built around 6 core principles:

1. **Simulation-First, Hardware-Second** - Development begins in simulation
2. **AI + Robotics Convergence** - Seamless integration of AI and robotics
3. **Human-Centered Humanoid Design** - Prioritizing human-like interaction patterns
4. **Progressive Complexity** - Structured learning from simple to complex
5. **Industry-Grade Tooling** - Using professional-grade tools (ROS 2, Isaac Sim)
6. **Learn by Building** - Every concept results in tangible, executable code

## 📖 Educational Content

The curriculum is structured around foundational concepts:

### Chapter 1: Foundations
1. **From Digital AI to Physical Intelligence** - Understanding the transition from abstract AI models to embodied agents
2. **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Mastering the communication framework for humanoid robots
3. **Digital Twins: Simulating Reality** - Creating virtual environments for testing and development

Each lesson includes hands-on labs and practical exercises that produce visible results, following the "Learn by Building" philosophy.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
